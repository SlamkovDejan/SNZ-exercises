## Expert systems
### Private lessons

This repository holds the code from the private lessons held by me for the 'Expert systems' course from FCSE - Skopje.
The code consists of solved exercises and helpful code for mastering some of the basic concepts covered in the mentioned course.

Some of the topics covered here from the 'Expert systems' course include: decision trees, document classification and recommender systems. The course programming language
is `python`. The `materials/` folder consists of the algorithms used in the exercises as well as a `usage.py` file which explores some of the basic features of `python`.
